Its very important to create a virtual environment otherwise scipy library will clash and throw error

In the terminal, run the following command to create a new virtual environment named "myenv"
SELECT COMMAND PROMPT IT WILL NOT RUN IN POWERSHELL
-->python -m venv myenv

Once the environment is created, activate it by running
-->.\myenv\Scripts\activate

With the environment activated you can install packages using pip
-->pip install package_name

When you're done working in the environment deactivate it by running
-->deactivate

After creating the environment, you may need to select it as the interpreter in VSCode. You can do this by clicking on the interpreter version displayed in the bottom-left corner of the VSCode window and selecting the desired environment.

ALWAYS REMEMBER TO ACTIVATE BEFORE START YOUR WORK AND DEACTIVATE AFTER
